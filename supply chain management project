Summary of Inventory and Supply Chain Management Analysis

✅ Warehouse Usage
Currently, only 34% of the warehouse space is being used — this is much lower than the target of 75%, meaning there’s a lot of unused space.

✅ Inventory Movement
The inventory turnover ratio is 23.47, which means products are selling and being replaced quite fast. The average time inventory stays before selling (Days Sales of Inventory) is about 15.5 days, which is a good sign of smooth flow.

✅ Sales Performance
Sales jumped massively from 11,000 units in 2021 to over 190,000 units in 2022 and have stayed strong, showing the business has grown a lot and is now maintaining steady sales.

✅ Transportation Costs
The West region has the highest transportation costs, across all product categories, which could be due to distance, supply issues, or transport inefficiencies.

✅ Lead Times
Accessories take the longest to deliver (average 16.6 days), while clothing is slightly faster (15.3 days).

✅ Backorders
There are many backorders:
838 fulfilled,
248 still pending,
114 canceled.
This shows some bottlenecks or delays in order processing.

✅ Inventory by Region
Clothing holds the largest inventory, especially in the East region. Overall, inventory levels are quite balanced across categories and regions.
